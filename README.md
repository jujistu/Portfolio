My portfolio built with next.js
i used tailwind css for styling
i used framer-motion for animation
i used clsx to render tailwind styles conditionally
i used react-icon for the icons
i used react intersection-observer for tracking element in view and out of view to set active state
i used react vertical timeline components for getting the vertical tree for my experience timeline
